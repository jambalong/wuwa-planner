# A Wuthering Waves Companion (Pangu Terminal)

### Project Overview

**Pangu Terminal** is a high-performance logistics and statistical engine designed to optimize resource management in *Wuthering Waves*. The project is designed as a suite of modular services aimed at solving complex player progression challenges and gacha probability.

#### Phase 1: Ascension Planner (MVP)
* **Goal:** Calculate total materials needed to reach character level goals.
* **Technical:** Implements **Recursive Active Record** associations to model multi-tier crafting costs (Basic → Advanced → Premium).

#### Phase 2: Inventory Hub & Wiki (The Data Nexus)
* **Goal:** Create a "Single Source of Truth" for user data and game knowledge.
* **Technical:** Implementing **Devise** for authentication and **Turbo Frames** for fast, inline inventory edits.

#### Phase 3: Astrite Analytics (Gacha Simulator)
* **Goal:** Advanced predictive modeling for gacha and resource spending.
* **Technical:** Using **Ruby Service Objects** for pity logic (Soft/Hard Pity) and **Solid Queue** for background processing.
